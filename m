No.  My "leave that for another day" below applies.

Both :)

My notes so far:

    Noted in review of intro conversions:

    1. Add missing markup to argument / member / feature references.

    2. Review and improve doc comments where the intro refers to arguments /
    members / features.

    3. Review and improve doc comments where the intro talks about failure
    modes.

    4. Consistently use imperative mood for command intros.

    5. Implement markup for non-local argument / member / feature
    references, and put it to use.
