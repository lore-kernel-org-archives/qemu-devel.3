+
+Configuring CPU features via ID register fields
+===============================================
+
+Note that this is currently only supported under KVM, and with the
+``host`` CPU model.
+
+Querying available ID register fields
+-------------------------------------
+
+QEMU will create properties for all ID register fields that are
+reported as being writable by the kernel, and that are known to the
+QEMU instance. Therefore, the same QEMU binary may expose different
+properties when run under a different kernel.
+
+To find out all available writable ID register fields, use the
+``query-cpu-model-expansion`` QMP command::
+
+  (QEMU) query-cpu-model-expansion type=full model={"name":"host"}
+  {"return": {
+   "model": {"name": "host", "props": {
+   "SYSREG_ID_AA64PFR0_EL1_EL3": 1, "SYSREG_ID_AA64ISAR2_EL1_CLRBHB": 0,
+   "SYSREG_CTR_EL0_L1Ip": 3, "SYSREG_CTR_EL0_DminLine": 4,
+   "SYSREG_ID_AA64MMFR0_EL1_BIGEND": 1, "SYSREG_ID_AA64MMFR1_EL1_ECBHB": 0,
+   "SYSREG_ID_AA64MMFR2_EL1_CnP": 1, "SYSREG_ID_DFR0_EL1_PerfMon": 4,
+   "SYSREG_ID_AA64PFR0_EL1_DIT": 0, "SYSREG_ID_AA64MMFR1_EL1_HAFDBS": 2,
+   "SYSREG_ID_AA64ISAR0_EL1_FHM": 0, "SYSREG_ID_AA64ISAR2_EL1_CSSC": 0,
+   "SYSREG_ID_AA64ISAR0_EL1_DP": 1, (...)
+   }}}}
+
+If a certain field in an ID register does not show up in this list, it
+is not writable with the specific host kernel.
+
+A note on compatibility
+-----------------------
+
+A common use case for providing a defined set of ID register values is
+to be able to present a fixed set of features to a guest, often referred
+to as "stable guest ABI". This may take the form of ironing out differences
+between two similar CPUs with the intention of being able to migrate
+between machines with those CPUs, or providing the same CPU across Linux
+kernel updates on the host.
+
+Over the course of time, the Linux kernel is changing the set of ID register
+fields that are writable by userspace. Newly introduced writable ID
+registers should be initialized to 0 to ensure compatibility. However, ID
+registers that have already been introduced that undergo a change as to
+which fields are writable may introduce incompatibilities that need to be
+addressed on a case-by-case basis for the systems that you wish to migrate
+inbetween.
+
+A note on Arm CPU features (FEAT_xxx)
+-------------------------------------
+
+Configuring CPUs is done on a feature level on other architectures, and this
+would imply configuring FEAT_xxx values on Arm. However, differences between
+CPUs may not map to FEAT_xxx, but to differences in other registers in the
+ID register range; for example, differences in the cache architecture exposed
+via ``CTR_EL0``. We therefore cannot rely on configuration via FEAT_xxx. A
+feature-based interface more similar to other architectures may be implemented
+on top of the ID register interface in the future.
