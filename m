This series enhances the current host KVM model with capability to
set writable ID reg fields.

Since v6.7 kernel, KVM/arm allows the userspace to overwrite the values
of a subset of ID regs. The list of writable fields continues to grow.
The feature ID range is defined as the AArch64 System register space
with op0==3, op1=={0, 1, 3}, CRn==0, CRm=={0-7}, op2=={0-7}.
  
The end goal is to get more flexibility when migrating guests
between different host hardware. This series is a prerequisite for
aarch64 named vcpu models.

QEMU retrieves the writable ID fields from KVM UAPI and
match them against a generated description of ID regs and their
named fields that stem from AARCHMRS Registers.json file.
Current description is based on latest 2026-03 edition.
The content of the generated files was compared against kernel
linux/arch/arm64/tools/sysreg file. It is not straightforward
to have unit tests for python scripts as there are many cases for
field extraction.
  
For each writable named field a uint64 property is created
following the "SYSREG_<REG>_<FIELD>" naming convention. REG and
FIELD names are those described in ARM ARM Reference manual.

SYSREG properties are applied at the end of the initialization
chain, after legacy composite options (sve, pauth, ...). They
do not substitute to them because legacy options do more than
just changing the value of ID registers. They may also interact
with KVM to init the vcpu with specific features or set some
VM capabilities. SYSREG properties just affect the corresponding
ID register field. Some checks are performed to make sure their
value is not inconsistent with legacy composite options.

The list of SYSREG properties can be retrieved through the qmp
monitor using query-cpu-model-expansion. They return the current
value for the corresponding field. The qmp command also allows to
test  setting new values. In static mode, they are tested at qemu
level only, against field length, arch enum values if any and
consistency with legacy composite options. With full expansion,
the values are tested against KVM using a scratch vcpu initialized
with the right legacy composite property values.

History:
--------
v9 -> v10:
addressed all Khushit's comments/suggestions. Here is the
list of main changes.

- MIDR, REVIDIR, MPIDR storage move (this may be sent as a
  separate prerequisite series)
- rebase on demux register handler that has just landed
  - update the json extractor accordingly
- Generate conditional enum values
- reorganize script patches to have the generated header
  in the same patch which is much easier to maintain
- New macro to encode arch enum value and ValueRanges which
  gives a much more compact header. Also enabled to remove
  check-patch error
- Put a maximum of code in cpu64.c instead of kvm.c to
  pave the way for other acceleration support. Also
  changed the consistency check handling by skipping potential
  new props that are known to collide with legacy composite options
- add writable_only param to pave the way for exposing all fields
  as props
- fixes in the qmp expansion code
