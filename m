So, did you explore doing this in a similar fashion to PCI enumeration?

That's done the bios and is very similar in that there is a mix of
policy and rules in how it is configured that we really don't want
in qemu.  With that ACPI tables are then built in QEMU that contain
values read back from what was setup. The main thing I'm thinking of
here is the PXB handling that relies on the bios having done the
PCI enumeration first rather than doing it in qemu.
The arm code is here
https://elixir.bootlin.com/qemu/v11.1.3/source/hw/pci-host/gpex-acpi.c#L103
x86 probably this:
https://elixir.bootlin.com/qemu/v11.1.3/source/hw/i386/acpi-build.c#L1038

My immediate instinct is that would look more like a conventional bios
flow.  It would also have the significant benefit of putting the enumerating
and configuration code into an open source bios, something I hoped would co=
me out
early ARM work on this (see linux plumbers - I think this is right session)
https://lpc.events/event/16/contributions/1254/attachments/1113/2136/CXL%20=
Type-3%20device%20discovery,%20configuration%20in%20firmware%20and%20prepar=
e%20ACPI%20tables%20for%20kernel%20usage.pdf

Then we'd regenerate the SRAT, HMAT etc before handling to the OS.
(I'm not sure this works for e820 having never touched that flow).

There is a lot of policy involved in CXL configuration and I'd not
want to replicate that part in QEMU. At best we'd want to pass
some hints to the bios.

Flow wise that would mean adding to acpi_build_update() some code
to do the necessary srat and other table updates.  That would
definitely work for the actual ACPI tables, but I gather e820 is
rather different...  However, e820 real table is I think
actually constructed by seabios so can that just make the
necessary updates after programming the CXL decoders etc?

Now if you did this on SBSA-ref and arm you'd have to do it
all in the bios (as that generates everything) and the whole
problem would be much more standard.

Given we have that option on arm/sbsa-ref I don't currently
see a reason to explore the bios flows on arm/virt.

I also gather (from asking an LLM so might be wrong) that there
are options that boot qemu on x86 with tables generated
by the bios, not qemu.  Legacy path in seabios, coreboot and
and ovmf path used with xen.  Maybe working with them avoids
the extra complexity of bounce backwards and forwards between
qemu and the firmware (though I think I'd probably avoid these).

Anyhow, interested to see where you go with this.
Definitely useful for those of us working with platforms that
never do the bios programmed flow but have to test it when
making changes!
