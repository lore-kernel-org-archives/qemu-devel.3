I agree with you on the fact that in general the association is fine. I
am confident that developpers who wrote 

arch/arm64/kernel/cpufeatures.c did it in a sensible way. Still the problem comes when the end user/layered products have to guess those string values which are documented/defined nowhere besides in cpufeatures.c. How will they come to know which string values are supported and how they map onto any valid ARM ARM ID reg value? You cannot point them to any reference doc. Refering to past comments, Marc said he would even prefer not using kernel sysreg as a root of trust (hence the choice of extracting info from AARCHMRS) so I anticipate using arch/arm64/kernel/cpufeatures.c as input may be frown upon. But I may be wrong.

I guess the usage of string values really depends on how many props layered products or user will need to set explicitly. Assuming we expose named models and this will be the main use case, my assumption is quite a few props will remain to be overriden on top of named model hardcorded values. And since the prop granularity is very low level anyway, if the end user has to identify and set an ID reg field, it can also set the associated uint64 value directly.

My point is that compared to the original series Connie and I have been pushing,
- you still use the same prop granularity (ID reg field), somehow abusively called feature
- you add significant complexity related to the string values (which are not referenced anywhere in the spec)
- you also add significant complexity related to different kinds and name patterns of props (FRAC, STRING, BOOLEAN, NUMERIC) while we only used SYSREG_REG_FIELD uint64_t props.

While I am really interested in layering up named models on top of ID reg field properties, or even a real feature upper level abstraction, I am not sure the above extra complexity is worth while keeping the original IDreg field granularity.

safe policy and value are kernel defined. To be honest I still fail to
understand why they are mandated for named vcpu models. Please could
elaborate again?
Why can't you start from the host values and override them with the
named vcpu model settings? If the new value cannot be applied by KVM, it
will reject it and fail the vcpu init.
Moreover if one ID reg field that needs to be overriden is not writable
with that host kernel, the prop won't exist and the named model won't
work on that host either.

to me, again, it would be if those values were properly specified which
is not the case.

Well I would imagine that a cloud vendor wants to migrate between
different hosts which call for a specific named model (so there is
minimal alignment between the vcpu model and the host cpu). In the worst
case it is always possible to instantiate scratch named model vcpus and
see if the vcpu init succeeds. We could even provide a qmp utility or
any other scheme that returns all valid vcpu models for that host.
Anyway I think this will be needed. or -cpu help may be enhanced to do
that, not simply returning the theoretical named models that are
available but the ones which actually apply on that kernel. I can help
you investigating that direction if it can come as an alternative.

try to apply it and the kernel will simply let you know. Why
reimplementing this in qemu as it is done on the kernel with the safe
policy/value infra.

This can be achieved in a different way, relying on the kernel.
Instantiate a scratch vcpu model and see if it inits. Some scratch vcpu
inits are already in place in qemu.

you can already introspect which ID reg are writables. You cannot get
the values that are valid for that host but any attempt to write invalid
values already fail the vcpu init. I tested that with kernel ID_FILTERED
id regs.

I guess it is normal because those regs are ID regs. The minimum level
of support comes from the various revisions and reference core
implementations. To me this is the huge job that needs to be done while
defining the various named models you drafted.

yeah the problem is you reimplemented a different infrastructure for the
same prop granularity as you did not rely nor ever commented on the
original series. So the first thing is to converge on the base infra
(props) definition and then build layered named models on top of it. As
we do not agree for now, let's wait for other's comments...
I a bit frustrated you did not communicate with us before so that we
could have initiated cooperation before and even make the original
series evolve in the direction you needed for named vcpu models.

But anyway, my end goal is to get those named models in a decent
timeframe so I am obviously willing to cooperate, hence the time I spend
reviewing your alternative implementation ;-)

well, named vcpu models hardcode 90% of the values, aren't they. Scratch
vcpu init attempts can let management layers know what named vcpu models
would work on that host I guess.

Yes but I mean for the end user, this ends up with different prop names
which does not make their life easier to me, instead of SYS_REG_FIELD
pattern. also keep in mind that FEAT_ props are not, strictly speaking
what the spec call FEAT.

I have further thought on this when respinning the original series into
v5. I believe the props can follow a hierarchy. ID reg field props are
the lowest level props and apply first. Then come the higher level
legacy options that are likely to override them. I am waiting for
comments on the series but this is proposal I would make.

OK. This is effectively an important aspect that, despite the value we
attempt to set on an ID reg field, KVM eventually does what he wants
with it according to its policy. I think it can ignore, sanitize, ...

To me there are several aspects
1) decide which ID reg properties are needed/better (unique uint64_t or
your various prop flavours)
2) usage of safe policy/value (is it really mandated). Why can't we use
scratch vcpus. Possibly if it is proven to be mandatory this is
independent on 1
3) definition of named models
