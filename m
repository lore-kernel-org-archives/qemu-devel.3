Still the problem comes when the end user/layered products have to guess those string values which are documented/defined nowhere besides in cpufeatures.c. How will they come to know which string values are supported and how they map onto any valid ARM ARM ID reg value? You cannot point them to any reference doc. Refering to past comments, Marc said he would even prefer not using

>>>> I guess the usage of string values really depends on how many props layered products or user will need to set explicitly. Assuming we expose named models and this will be the main use case, my assumption is quite a few props will remain to be overriden on top of named model hardcorded values. And since the prop granularity is very low level anyway, if the end user has to identify and set an ID reg field, it can also set the associated uint64 value directly.

> For example MPAM is not writable by KVM, hence only one supported value “0.0”,
I guess this 0.0 value is retrieved from the host and does not come from
a default value, right?.
> CSV2 on the host is only “1.0” (architecturally, 2.0 is also valid), hence only “0.0” and “1.0” in the supported values.
OK so here you use the safe rule to determine what valid values are left.

what are unavailable features? not writable? not settable because the
host already supports the only value regarding the safe rule?

>>>>>>>         feat_MPAM, etc.
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>             The property name is set as "feat_<BaseFieldName>" and possible
>>>>>>>             values are the arch-defined string values like "0.0", "1.0", "1.1",
>>>>>>>             etc.
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>             Fractional properties are defined as:
>>>>>>>             ARM_FRACTIONAL_PROP("prop_name", base_reg, base_field, frac_reg, frac_field)
>>>>>>>             Example:

>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>             When a fractional property is set, both the base field and frac
>>>>>>>             field values are set to the corresponding values.
>>>>>>>             E.g: feat_CSV2=1.1 will set ID_AA64PFR0.CSV2=1 and ID_AA64PFR1.CSV2_FRAC=1.
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>     - Composite properties (planned for v2):
>>>>>>>        These will act as master boolean switches that control a list of
>>>>>>>        fields. Example: pauth, sve, etc. Setting sve=on with a named model
>>>>>>>        will set all the SVE-related fields (ID_AA64ZFR0_EL1.*) along with
>>>>>>>        sveNNN vector-length. Similarly, setting pauth=on will set APA, GPA,
>>>>>>>        API, GPA3, GPI, GPA3 fields based on the named model.
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>     - cpu_revision, cpu_partnum, etc. properties are introduced to expose
>>>>>>>       MIDR, REVIDR, AIDR fields.
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>     Exceptions to the property naming are made for ID_AA64PFR0_EL1.ELx
>>>>>>>     fields, which are named elx_mode.
>>>>>> yet another naming exception. 
>>>>> A better name is always welcome! We can iterate over both the prop name and

>>>> yeah but is it making end user life easier?

>>>>> Agreed, This needs more thoughts. It is not a part of this RFC.

>>> Interesting, will look through the v5 code.

>>>>>>> 3. ARM CPU Model Hierarchy:
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>> A small named model layer is defined on top of the properties. An ARM named
>>>>>>> CPU model defines a list of property values and a parent model. A child
>>>>>>> model naturally inherits all the properties from its parent and can
>>>>>>> override them when needed.
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>> The initial model hierarchy shipped here is:
>>>>>>>  kvm-base-v1                  KVM-imposed quirks
>>>>>>>    arm-v8_4-a-v1              ARMv8.4-A architectural mandate
>>>>>>>        neoverse-v1-v1         Neoverse V1
>>>>>>>                 graviton3-v1         AWS Graviton3
>>>>>>>             arm-v9_0-a-v1            ARMv9.0-A architectural deltas on top of ARM-v8_4-a-v1
>>>>>>>        neoverse-v2-v1         Neoverse V2
>>>>>>>          grace-v1             NVIDIA Grace
>>>>>> Do you have a strategy for named model validation, besides code review.
>>>>>> At least each vcpu named model shall be introduced in separate patch,
>>>>>> overrides clearly explained and links to the reference spec shall be
>>>>>> precisely given for review.
>>>>> Agreed, each model should be in a separate patch, with overrides and new
>>>>> introductions clearly mentioned/documented with supporting ID register dumps.
>>>> Yes I believe it is a huge work to assess the correctness of the
>>>> definition.
>>> I hope in long term vendors will chime in.
>>>
>>>>>>> (kvm-base-v1 and arm-vX are not meant to be realizable unless the
>>>>>>> user provides values for implementation-defined fields)
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>> So for example, grace-v1 defines Crypto fields and CTR_EL0.IDC/DIC on top
>>>>>>> of neoverse-v2-v1, which leaves those fields vendor-configurable.
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>> The hierarchy reflects a deliberate trade-off:
>>>>>>> - Architecture-level models (arm-v8_4-a-v1) maximize migration
>>>>>>>  compatibility but lack implementation-defined values.
>>>>>>> - Reference-core models (neoverse-v2-v1) enable migration across
>>>>>>>  SoCs sharing the same core design.
>>>>>>> - SoC models (grace-v1) expose the full hardware feature set but
>>>>>>>  limit migration to hosts with the same SoC.
>>>>>> What kind of migration did you exercise up to now?
>>>>> Successful same host migration with named models and migration
>>>>> from grace to graviton3 with neoverse-v1.
>>>>>
>>>>>>> At model realization time,
>>>>>>>  1. a clean slate of cpu.isar.idregs[] is created using
>>>>>>>        arm_idregs_reset_to_defaults().
>>>>>>>     2. Then, a model's full parent-chain is walked and all properties are
>>>>>>>        applied in order from parent to child.
>>>>>>>     3. Finally, kvm_arm_writeback_idregs() compares the model's desired
>>>>>>>        ID-register values against the host-provided cpreg snapshot and
>>>>>>>        writes back the writable bits, warning on any non-writable difference.
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>> Models will follow a monotonic versioning convention (grace-v1, grace-v2,
>>>>>>> ...) mirroring x86's scheme.
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>> * Please take the CPU model property values with a grain of salt.
>>>>>>> They are added based on what the guest-visible values are with "host"
>>>>>>> model on available hardware.
>>>>>> I don't catch the above statement.
>>>>> They don’t match the exact hardware specs. For example feat_CSV2 is capped
>>>>> at “1.0” by KVM regardless of what the hardware says. On Neoverse-v2, TRM
>>>>> says FEAT_CSV2_2 is implemented (i.e “2.0”)
>>>> OK. This is effectively an important aspect that, despite the value we
>>>> attempt to set on an ID reg field, KVM eventually does what he wants
>>>> with it according to its policy. I think it can ignore, sanitize, ...
>>>>>>> Benefits of this design:
>>>>>>>     - General benefits that come with properties and named CPU models,
>>>>>>>       like cross-host live migration, management-stack control over
>>>>>>>       feature exposure, etc.
>>>>>>>     - Forward compatibility: when a new ID register or field is
>>>>>>>       introduced, CPU models need not change; during realization they
>>>>>>>       will be populated with the default values. Only ID register/field
>>>>>>>       information needs to be added to the field table.
>>>>>>>     - As CPU models are hierarchical, defining a new model is much easier.
