Where there are two, there are almost certainly more.

Text that refers to arguments should probably go below the argument
descriptions.  I.e. this "intro" should probably be split.

Let's leave that for another day, just take note of future work:

1. Add missing markup to argument / member / feature references.

2. Review and improve doc comments where the intro refers to arguments /
members / features.

Not noting any of this again for this series.

Perhaps the "will fail" part should be in an Errors: section.

The intros above use imperative mode, this one doesn't.  Elsewhere in
this series, I even saw "Command to <do stuff>".

More notes:

3. Review and improve doc comments where the intro talks about failure
modes.

4. Consistently use imperative mood for command intros.

Not noting any of this again for this series.
