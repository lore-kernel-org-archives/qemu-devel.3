I think the multi-bit property may be a better approach (which I
previously referred to as “numeric features”).

As Igor pointed out, this would involve an infrastructure change, so I
am hesitant to pursue it at this time.

Yes, it works. Will post V2 with this approach.

For a migratable feature, it's related state should be fully captured in
the VM migration stream.  Both the LBR and PEBS states are serialized
via vmstate, so it may not be wrong to call labr/pebs_fmt a migratable
feature.

However, QEMU must provide means—either to external management
applications via QOM properties or to users via command-line options—to
ensure that the destination machine supports all features enabled on the
source. The current migratable_flags proposal does not address this.

My original intention was to treat this as a workaround.
