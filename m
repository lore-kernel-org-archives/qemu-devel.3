Hi Michael,

I am giving this a go on Arm CCA on top of Ackerley's KVM patches.

When convert-in-place is switched on I think that the post conversion
hook should not trigger discard+hole-punch since now guest-memfd _is_
the memory back-end but it looks like there is no guard in place against
that (I noticed that ram_block_discard_range() triggers a hole-punch in
kvm_post_convert_section() - when the CCA guest first requests a
KVM_EXIT_MEMORY_FAULT to convert to private).

It is a question really.

Thanks,
Lorenzo
